#### Tracker found to be on park location.

Seems like software was freeze.

Radmon-pc was rebooted -> tracker working properly.

Sighting seems correct.


#### All BB instruments have bad data!!!!!

Seems like a step of values before and after reboot!!!

Maybe normal clouds or something was actually wrong
