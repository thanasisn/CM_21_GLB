## Calibration/amplification dates error

Period 2004-07-03 to 2004-07-22 seems the conversion factor is wrong.

- check original calibration factor
- test with different amplification/date
- ask Bais


## Improve QCrad flagging

- finish the new version
- hunt for bad data


## Use the new calibration data

- check the validity?


## Do a comparison with inclined CM-21 

For the period CM-21 was missing for calibration
