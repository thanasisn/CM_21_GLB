# CM_21_GLB

## May use QCrad for pre processing

We already do some filtering of bad data in CM-21

## Calibration/amplification dates error [ ]

Period 2004-07-03 to 2004-07-22 seems the conversion factor is wrong.

- check original calibration factor [ ]
- test with different amplification/date [ ]
- ask Bais [ ]


    
## Do a comparison with inclined CM-21 

For the period CM-21 was missing for calibration


## Implement a data history columns 

Similar to GC
